To connect to the compute node  on Ibex running your Jupyter server, 
you need to create an ssh tunnel from your local machine to login node on Ibex 
using the following command.

ssh -L 12322:cn506-07-l:12322 medinils@ilogin.ibex.kaust.edu.sa 

Next, you need to copy the second url provided below and paste it into the browser 
on your local machine.
